* No need to change the **TESTNET_URL** and the **MUMBAI_URL**
* Note that the smart contract is deployed in **POLYGON MUMBAI TESTNET**. Hence, mumbai faucet will be needed in testing the smart contract. Faucet can be gotten here ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ https://mumbaifaucet.com/

# COMPILATION
Enter the command shown below to compile your solidity code
```
truffle compile
```
# DEPLOYMENT
The script ```1_deploy_contracts.js``` under the migrations directory is the one deploying the smart contract.<br/> 
Enter the command shown below to deploy the smart contract to mumbai test network
```
truffle deploy --network matic
```
# Running Tests
The test file can be found in **test\skillsForge.js**. The test file has two categories of test;
* Test for the deposit() function in the smart contract. The deposit function allows users to deposit MATIC in the smart contract. To run that particular test, type the command below in the terminal
```
truffle test -- -g "should be able to deposit ether into the SkillsForgeContract"
```

* Test for the withdraw() function. The deposit function allows users to withdraw the money they've already deposited. The smart contract is designed in a way that only users that have MATIC in the contract can withdraw. The command below can be used to run this test;
```
truffle test -- -g "should be able to deposit ether into the SkillsForgeContract"
```
   
* The getBalance() function has also been tested during the course of testing the withdraw and the deposit functions.

* Note that the test is using truffle test network. This is to ensure faster execution and to save gas. 

# Running Scripts
